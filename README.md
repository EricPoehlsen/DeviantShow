# DeviantShow
***by Eric PÃ¶hlsen***

Until 2016 DeviantArt.com featured a flash based slideshow on its website called sitback. 
Some time in fall 2016 this feature was gone, unfortunatly, as I'd like to mention. 
To be honest, that slideshow was not really good, there was no random slideshow for example.
But that is still better than no slideshow feature at all. 

This program is a webscraper that can be used to watch any deviantart.com gallery or favourites collection.

## Usage
Start the program, paste a DeviantArt.com gallery url into the address bar and press "Play".
If you have an active internet connection, your slideshow should start after a few moments. 

## License
I will not specify a license. This software is to be regarded as "Open Source" and "Public Domain". 
Use it however you like. However I'd like to point out that just changing the authors name in the 
'about' dialog is not what I envision as fair use of open source software. 

## FAQ
Okay technically no one has asked any of those questions yet, but I decided to answer them proactively ...

No. It is not necessary to provide any login credentials for deviantart.com

#### So what about mature content?
Do not worry, you'll get all that dirty mature content you are looking for.

DeviantArt.com provides an RSS feed for it's contents. 
The gallery url you provide is used to request the appropriate rss from which the image relevant URLs are than retrieved. 

#### Will I get into trouble using this tool?
I honestly hope not. In my personal opinion using this tool is not violating the DeviantArt Terms of Service.
The RSS feed is provided as a publicly available service. The images will be downloaded as needed, not in bulk.
If you do not delete the contents of the downloads folder, the images should be only downloaded once.

#### But don't they live from the ads?
Yes they do, so if you really want to support DeviantArt but like to use the slideshow anyway get a Core membership. 

#### This software is great I'd like to pay you some money?
Seriously?! Okay go ahead 

#### This program is a piece of crap and ...
No one forces you to use it. If you don't like it, don't use it.

#### Can you make a slideshow for ***.com
Short answer, I probably won't. But have a look at the
